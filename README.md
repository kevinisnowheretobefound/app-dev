### My Favorite Series

**Macross**
> Macross is a sci-fi and mecha anime series.

> The Macross has multiple series that the story flows through generations.

> The plot is all about the "protoculture" they've been exploring through different galaxies. Protoculture is like a culture but it contains different races of living, way of living, and beliefs. Every galaxy has different protoculture. People or humans are the center of the series, they explore and evolve through the findings in different galaxies and the human culture is advancing.
